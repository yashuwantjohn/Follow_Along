# Ecommerce-Follow-Along Project Overview

## Project Description
Ecommerce-Follow-Along is a comprehensive project designed to guide developers through the process of building an e-commerce application from scratch. This project will cover various aspects of web development, including front-end design, back-end integration, and database management, providing a hands-on learning experience.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In this session, we focused on the foundational elements of the Ecommerce-Follow-Along project. Key topics covered included:

### 1. *Project Setup*
   - We initialized the GitHub repository and set up the basic structure for our application.

### 2. *Technology Stack*
   - An overview of the technologies that will be utilized throughout the project:
     - *Node.js*: JavaScript runtime for the back-end.
     - *Express.js*: Web framework for building the back-end API.
     - *MongoDB*: NoSQL database to store application data.
     - *React (MUI)*: Front-end framework using React with Material-UI for UI components.

### 3. *Version Control*
   - Introduction to *Git* and *GitHub* for version control.
   - Emphasized best practices for committing code and managing branches.

### 4. *Development Environment*
   - Configuration of local development environments to ensure consistency across team members.

   
## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page
In this milestone, we focused on setting up the initial front-end structure and implementing the login page for the application. Key achievements include:
  
### Front-End Framework:
Set up the React framework with Vite for a fast and modern development experience.
### Folder Structure:
Organized the src folder to include separate directories for components, pages, and assets to improve scalability and maintainability.
### Login Page Implementation:
Developed a basic login page (Login.jsx) that includes a user interface for email and password input.
Incorporated validation logic to ensure proper user input.
### Routing:
Implemented React Router for navigation and created routes for the login and signup pages.
### Styling:
Added basic styling using CSS (App.css) to ensure a clean and user-friendly design.
### Git Integration:
Added the new files to version control and committed progress to the GitHub repository.
This milestone lays the groundwork for creating the front-end interface and interaction logic for the application.


## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

In this milestone, the foundational backend structure for the e-commerce application was successfully established. Key achievements include:

### Backend Folder Structure:
Organized the project into clearly defined folders (config, controller, db, middleware, model, and utility) to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### Database Integration:
Set up a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose, enabling seamless interaction with the database.
Environment Configuration
Implemented a .env file to securely manage sensitive data such as database credentials, ensuring better security practices.
Middleware Implementation
Created essential middleware for authentication, error handling, and asynchronous error management to streamline request processing and ensure robust error handling.
Utility Functions
-Added reusable utility components like a custom error handler to improve consistency and simplify debugging.

### Git Integration
Configured version control with Git and included a .gitignore file to exclude sensitive files and unnecessary folders like node_modules.
