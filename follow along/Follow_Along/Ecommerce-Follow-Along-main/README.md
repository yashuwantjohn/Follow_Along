# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Project Description

Ecommerce-Follow-Along is a comprehensive project designed to guide developers through the process of building an e-commerce application from scratch. This project will cover various aspects of web development, including front-end design, back-end integration, and database management, providing a hands-on learning experience.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In this session, we focused on the foundational elements of the Ecommerce-Follow-Along project. Key topics covered included:

- **Project Setup**: We initialized the GitHub repository and set up the basic structure for our application.
- **Technology Stack**: An overview of the technologies that will be utilized throughout the project, such as Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and React(Material UI).
- **Version Control**: Introduction to Git and GitHub for version control, emphasizing best practices for committing code and managing branches.
- **Development Environment**: Configuration of local development environments to ensure consistency across team members.

This milestone sets the stage for further development and deeper exploration of e-commerce functionalities in upcoming sessions.


## Milestone 2: Project Setup

In this milestone, we created a login page using react and tailwind css. Then we linked it to the app.jsx using a loginPage.jsx in the pages folder. Here, we learned about the differences between css and tailwind css and how to use it effectively.

## Milestone 3: Project Setup

In this milestone, we setup dedicated folders for organizing backend code like models,controllers,routes and middleware. Then we initialized it with Node.js server and then created a server.js file. Later, we connected MongoDB to our application. Finally, we implemented basic error handling
